By God's grace, our community has grown steadily ever since our [founding](/about/) in 1981.
As Charlotte has overflowed with faith, families, and vocations, so too has our small chapel.

To accomodate our expanding congregation, the General Council of the SSPX in Switzerland has
authorized us to purchase a property on which to build a new church complex.

## Help build a new home for Tradition!{.noclear}

The time has come to build a new home for Tradition in the Carolinas: a church worthy to sustain
us and our descendants with the fullness of Catholic life.

> We will create a place of lasting permanence and distinct beauty.
> It will glorify God in its magnificence, and it will serve as a font
> of sacramental grace and Christian life for His people for countless generations.
> It will be the seedbed of saints.

Realizing this vision depends first and foremost on your prayers, but also
on your financial support.
To help us obtain this property, consider [making your contribution](#/fundraising/forms/PYEVM6DX) to our capital campaign.
