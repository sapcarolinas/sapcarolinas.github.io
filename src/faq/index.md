## What is the SSPX?

The [Priestly Society of Saint Pius X](https://sspx.org/en) (<abbr>SSPX</abbr>) is a fraternity of Catholic priests
founded by His Excellency, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in 1970. Dedicated to traditional
priestly formation and the traditional Latin Mass, the SSPX celebrates all Sacraments according
to their forms prior to the Second Vatican Council.


## Which Sacraments do you offer?

**Holy Mass** is offered on Saturdays, Sundays, and Holy Days of obligation, unless otherwise [announced](/news/).

**Confessions** are heard 45 minutes prior to Holy Mass.

For the Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Marriage, you must be
[registered](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tSTJ8jiqDTp_lOUH_mghFVU2Pke9matCISseFaC2jus/viewform)
at the chapel and meet with our priest so that you may become acquainted.
These Sacraments require appropriate spiritual preparation under his guidance.

For gravely urgent sick calls or emergencies, dial our Sacramental Emergency Hotline.
Note that this number is for **emergency use only**:

## Can I receive Holy Communion?

The reception of Holy Communion is reserved for practicing Catholics in the state of grace.

Specifically, to receive Holy Communion: One must be a baptized and practicing Catholic,
having made a good confession since the last committed mortal sin (if any) in order to be
in the state of Grace, and one must not be a public sinner (living in sin with another,
married outside the Church, etc.)

One must observe at least one hour of Eucharistic fast (water and medicine do not break the fast).
The most important requirement is to have a great desire to receive the Body, Blood, Soul, and
Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Those not receiving Holy Communion should simply remain in their pew.

## Will I be welcome as a guest?

You will always be warmly welcomed by the faithful of Saint Anthony's, especially our
friendly ushers. After Sunday Mass, you will find that many families bring lunch and socialize
together at length in our outdoor Pavilion.


## What should I wear to Mass?

Out of respect for Our Lord and edification of our neighbor, men and women are asked to
dress with modesty and dignity.

### Gentlemen 

Gentlemen are asked to remove their hats before entering the chapel. Slacks along with a
coat and tie are the most appropriate attire. Casual clothing such as jeans, T-shirts, and
shorts are considered inappropriate for Holy Mass.

### Ladies

Ladies are asked to have their heads covered in church with either a hat or chapel veil.
Chapel veils are available in the vestibule for ladies in need of one. Dresses or skirts
are the most appropriate attire, and these should reach past the knee. Dresses and blouses
which are sleeveless or low cut should be avoided.

### Prudential Note

By God's grace, our chapel is blessed with many newcomers who are discovering Catholic
tradition for the very first time.
*Let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you. And hospitality do not forget;
for by this some, being not aware of it, have entertained angels. (Heb 13:1-2)*
